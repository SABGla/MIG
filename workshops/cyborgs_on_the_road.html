											<h2>Cyborgs on the Road: Workshop on Augmenting Road Users to Quantify their Behaviour</h2>

											<p>We are excited to announce that we will run a workshop on augmenting road users at the <a href="https://augmented-humans.org/" >Augmented Humans '23 conference <\a> here in Glasgow!</p>

											<h3>Workshop Introduction</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                There is an increasing number of studies evaluating road user (e.g. cyclists or drivers) behaviour in traffic. These are important for informing traffic safety, road infrastructure design and the impact of automated vehicles on traffic. Road user evaluations often involve collecting data such as perceived safety and motion sickness. However, collecting objective, quantified forms of these behaviours is challenging. Experimenters commonly measure these with questionnaires after the study. Finding solutions to collect these data in real-time without relying on participants' subjective input could result in more rigorous study designs and a better understanding of user behaviour. This workshop aims to gain insights on how road users may be augmented with devices, such as heart rate monitors, in evaluation studies to quantify behaviour on-the-go. The workshop will result in study designs that augment road users to quantify their behaviour, which would inform future research with novel techniques for data collection. 
                                            </p>
