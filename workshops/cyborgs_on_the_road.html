											<h2>Cyborgs on the Road: Workshop on Augmenting Road Users to Quantify their Behaviour</h2>

											<p>We are excited to announce that we will run a workshop on augmenting road users at the <a href="https://augmented-humans.org/">Augmented Humans '23 conference</a> here in Glasgow!</p>

											<h3>Workshop Introduction</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                There is an increasing number of studies evaluating road user (e.g. cyclists or drivers) behaviour in traffic. These are important for informing traffic safety, road infrastructure design and the impact of automated vehicles on traffic. Road user evaluations often involve collecting data such as perceived safety and motion sickness. However, collecting objective, quantified forms of these behaviours is challenging. Experimenters commonly measure these with questionnaires after the study. Finding solutions to collect these data in real-time without relying on participants' subjective input could result in more rigorous study designs and a better understanding of user behaviour. This workshop aims to gain insights on how road users may be augmented with devices, such as heart rate monitors, in evaluation studies to quantify behaviour on-the-go. The workshop will result in study designs that augment road users to quantify their behaviour, which would inform future research with novel techniques for data collection. 
                                            </p>

His research focuses on multimodal HCI or using multiple sensory modalities and control mechanisms (particularly audio, haptics and gesture) to create a rich, natural interaction between humans and computers. His work has a strong experimental focus, applying perceptual research to practical situations. A long-term focus has been on mobile interaction and how we can design better user interfaces for users who are on the move. Other areas of interest include haptics, wearable devices and in-car interaction. He pioneered the study of non-speech audio and haptic interaction for mobile devices with work starting in the 1990s.
