											<h2>AutoUI'23: Workshop on Multimodal Motion Sickness Detection and Mitigation Methods for Car Journeys</h2>

											<p>We are excited to announce that we will run a workshop on multimodal motion sickness detection and mitigation methods for car Journeys at the <a href="https://www.auto-ui.org/23/">AutoUI '23 conference</a> in Ingolstadt, Germany!</p>

											<h3>Workshop Introduction</h3>
                                            <p>
                                            This workshop will build on the goals defined in the <a href="https://autoui22workshopmotionsickness.wordpress.com/">previous workshop</a>, (1) highlighting the need for motion sickness research in the future of AVs, (2) strengthen the community of motion sickness researchers by facilitating collaboration across research domains, institutions and industry to further contribute to the success ad progression in the field, and most pressingly (3) this workshop will form the basis for a consensus in the research field regarding methodologies used and will aid the development of guidelines for motion sickness researches to improve and speed up the design stage of research studies allow for direct comparison between studies between research groups and allow for easy replication of findings. In this workshop the organisers will bring together members of the AutoUI community and beyond as well as researchers from the industry with a background in motion sickness research.</p>

                                            <h3>Important Dates and Call for Participation</h3>

                                                    You can also share and present your own work during this workshop. Participants can submit a short abstract outlining the work they would like to present. The organisers will then select a few of the submission for presentations. Each presentation is about 3 min long with 2 min for questions.
